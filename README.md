Objective: The objective of my game is to catch healthy foods (core power, oiko yogurt) and to avoid junk foods (pizza, burger, hotdog) that come to you from the y and x axis. 
Each time you catch a healthy food, the score increases. Every time you catch junk food, the score decreases and you lose a live. There are 10 lives and you can reset the amount
if you reach a score of 30 or 60. 

Instructions: The player moves up, down, left, right, and transports to the bottom left of the screen for emergency situations. The arrow and space keys are used in this game.
